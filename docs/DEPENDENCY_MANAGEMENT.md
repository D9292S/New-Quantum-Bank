# Dependency Management Guide

This document explains how to properly manage dependencies for the Quantum Bank project.

## Understanding the Project Setup

The Quantum Bank project uses:

- **pyproject.toml**: Main dependency declaration file
- **requirements.txt**: Generated/frozen dependency file
- **uv.lock**: Lock file generated by uv package manager

## Python Version Requirements

This project requires **Python 3.9 or higher**. Some dependencies (like motor-stubs) specifically require Python 3.9+, which is why we've set this as the minimum version.

If you encounter version compatibility issues, make sure you're using Python 3.9 or newer.

## Important Note on Discord Library

This project uses **py-cord** as its Discord API library but continues to use `import discord` in the code. This works because:

1. py-cord is a fork of discord.py that maintains API compatibility
2. py-cord installs itself to be importable via the `discord` namespace
3. This allows the code to work with either discord.py or py-cord

If you encounter any compatibility issues, please ensure you are using the correct version of py-cord (2.x+).

## Note on Type Stubs

We've removed the `types-pymongo` dependency as it causes issues with dependency resolution in some environments. Instead, we've configured mypy to ignore missing imports for MongoDB-related packages:

```toml
[[tool.mypy.overrides]]
module = ["pymongo.*", "mongomock.*"]
ignore_missing_imports = true
```

This approach is sufficient for type checking without requiring the external type stubs package.

## Updating Dependencies

When you need to add or update a dependency:

1. **Edit pyproject.toml**:
   ```toml
   # In the dependencies section
   dependencies = [
       "new-package>=1.0.0",
       # other dependencies...
   ]

   # Or for dev dependencies
   [project.optional-dependencies]
   development = [
       "dev-package>=2.0.0",
       # other dev dependencies...
   ]
   ```

2. **Regenerate requirements.txt**:
   ```bash
   uv pip compile pyproject.toml --upgrade --output-file requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Update your environment**:
   ```bash
   # Either using uv (recommended)
   uv pip install -e .

   # Or for development dependencies
   uv pip install -e ".[development]"

   # Or using pip
   pip install -e .
   pip install -e ".[development]"
   ```

## Common Issues

### Lock File Conflicts

If you manually edit pyproject.toml and see dependency conflicts:

```bash
# Regenerate requirements.txt
uv pip compile pyproject.toml --upgrade --output-file requirements.txt

# Then reinstall the project
uv pip install -e .
```

### Missing Type Stubs

Some packages don't have type stubs available in PyPI. For these packages:

1. Add an override in the mypy section of pyproject.toml:
   ```toml
   [[tool.mypy.overrides]]
   module = ["problem_package.*"]
   ignore_missing_imports = true
   ```

2. Or install the specific stubs directly:
   ```bash
   pip install types-package-name
   ```

## Development Workflow

For development, we recommend:

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[development,testing]"
   ```

3. Install pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

This ensures you have all the tools needed for development, testing, and code quality.
