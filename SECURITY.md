# Security Policy

## Dependency Management

### Vulnerability Management

1. **Regular Scanning**: Dependencies are scanned weekly for security vulnerabilities.
2. **Update Policy**:
   - Critical vulnerabilities: Update within 24 hours
   - High severity: Update within 7 days
   - Medium severity: Update within 30 days
   - Low severity: Update during regular maintenance

### Version Pinning

All dependencies in our project use version pinning with upper bounds to prevent automatic updates that might introduce breaking changes or vulnerabilities.

### Security Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability in any of our dependencies, please report it by:

1. Creating a GitHub issue with the "Security" label
2. Emailing us at security@quantum-superbot.example.com
3. NOT disclosing the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed

## Package Management Security

### UV Package Manager

We use UV for package management, with the following security practices:

1. Lock files are always committed to the repository
2. The `uv pip sync` command is used for consistent dependency installation
3. Package sources are limited to PyPI

### Installation Verification

When installing dependencies, always use the following command to ensure consistent versions:

```bash
uv pip sync pyproject.toml
```

## Audit Procedures

1. **Quarterly Audit**: Full dependency review is conducted quarterly
2. **Pre-Release Audit**: All dependencies are audited before major releases
3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Automated scanning is in place for newly discovered vulnerabilities

## Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure practices for security vulnerabilities. If you discover a vulnerability, please allow us reasonable time to address it before public disclosure.
