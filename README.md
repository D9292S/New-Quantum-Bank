## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- MongoDB database (local or Atlas)
- Discord Bot Token

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/quantum-bank-bot.git
   cd quantum-bank-bot
   ```

2. Install uv if you don't have it yet:
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```
   Or on Windows:
   ```bash
   powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
   ```

3. Install the package with dependencies (uv will automatically create a virtual environment):
   ```bash
   uv pip install -e "."
   ```

   For development setup, include development dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv pip install -e ".[development]"
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
   ```
   BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   MAL_CLIENT_ID=your_myanimelist_client_id  # Optional, for anime commands
   ACTIVITY_STATUS=Quantum Bank | /help  # Custom status
   DEBUG=false  # Set to true for debug mode
   ```

5. Run the bot using uv scripts:
   ```bash
   uv run run
   ```

   Or with debug mode:
   ```bash
   uv run run-debug
   ```

## Available Commands

The project includes several useful commands:

```bash
# Run the bot
python -m launcher

# Run the bot in debug mode
python -m launcher --debug

# Run the bot with high performance settings
python -m launcher --performance high

# Run the bot with verbose logging
python -m launcher --log-level verbose

# Run the bot with quiet logging (only warnings and errors)
python -m launcher --log-level quiet

# Run tests
pytest

# Run only unit tests
pytest tests/unit

# Run only integration tests
pytest tests/integration

# Run tests with coverage report
pytest --cov=./ --cov-report=term

# Run linting
ruff check .

# Format code
black .

# Check formatting without changing files
black --check .

# Fix linting issues and format code in one command
ruff check --fix . && black .
```

After installation via `uv pip install -e "."`, you can also run:

```bash
# Run the bot using the entry point
quantum-bank
```

## Advanced Configuration

Quantum Bank supports advanced configuration options for scaling and performance. These can be accessed using specialized scripts:

```bash
# Run with high performance mode
uv run run-performance-high

# Run with verbose logging
uv run run-verbose

# Run with quiet logging (only warnings and errors)
uv run run-quiet

# Run with debug mode
uv run run-debug
```

For more specific configurations, you'll need to use the launcher directly:

```bash
# Run with specific number of shards
python -m launcher --shards 3

# Run as part of a cluster
python -m launcher --cluster 0 --clusters 3

# Combine multiple options
python -m launcher --performance high --log-level verbose --shards 3
```

You can also configure these options via environment variables in your `.env` file:

```
BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
MONGO_URI=mongodb://username:password@host:port/dbname
DEBUG=false
PERFORMANCE_MODE=medium  # Options: low, medium, high
SHARD_COUNT=1
```

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

The bot can be easily deployed using Docker:

```bash
# Build and run using docker-compose (development mode)
docker-compose --profile dev up -d

# Build and run using docker-compose (production mode)
docker-compose --profile prod up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f bot
```

For custom configurations, edit the `.env` file or override environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`.

#### Container Details

- **Bot**: Main Discord bot service
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing accounts, transactions, etc.
- **Redis**: Optional caching and shared state for clustered deployments

#### Scaling with Docker Compose

For multiple bot instances (clustered deployment):

```bash
# Scale to 3 bot instances in production mode
docker-compose --profile prod up -d --scale bot=3
```

Don't forget to properly configure your .env with appropriate sharding settings.

### VPS/Dedicated Server

For production use on a VPS, we recommend:

- A VPS with at least 1GB RAM
- Setting up a systemd service for auto-restart
- Using a monitoring solution like PM2

Example systemd service file (`/etc/systemd/system/quantum-bank.service`):

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Quantum Bank Discord Bot
After=network.target

[Service]
User=quantum
WorkingDirectory=/opt/quantum-bank
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 -m launcher --performance medium
Restart=always
RestartSec=10
StandardOutput=syslog
StandardError=syslog
SyslogIdentifier=quantum-bank

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Enable and start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable quantum-bank
sudo systemctl start quantum-bank
```
