# Quantum Bank Database Optimizations

This directory contains performance optimizations for Quantum Bank's MongoDB database operations.

## Contents

- `mongodb_improvements.py`: Core implementations of MongoDB optimization strategies including:
  - Query optimization
  - Smart caching
  - Bulk operations
  - Index recommendations

- `mongodb_implementation_plan.md`: Phased approach for implementing the optimizations

## Usage

To use these optimizations, import the required functions or classes from the modules:

```python
# Smart caching for frequently accessed data
from optimizations.mongodb_improvements import smart_cache

@smart_cache(ttl=300)
async def your_database_method(self, user_id):
    # Your implementation
    pass

# Bulk operations for batch processing
from optimizations.mongodb_improvements import BulkOperations

await BulkOperations.update_many_accounts(self.db, query, update)

# Query optimization
from optimizations.mongodb_improvements import optimize_query

optimized_query = optimize_query(original_query)
results = await collection.find(optimized_query)
```

## Implementation Strategy

Refer to `mongodb_implementation_plan.md` for a detailed approach to implementing these optimizations in phases.

## Benefits

- Reduced database load
- Faster response times for users
- Better scalability under high loads
- Lower operational costs due to more efficient resource usage

## Best Practices

When implementing these optimizations:

1. Always benchmark before and after to measure impact
2. Add optimizations incrementally, not all at once
3. Monitor for any unexpected behavior
4. Maintain comprehensive test coverage
