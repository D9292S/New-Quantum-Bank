# Canary Deployment Strategy for Quantum-Superbot

This document outlines the canary deployment strategy implemented for Quantum-Superbot, explaining how new versions are gradually rolled out to minimize risk and detect issues early.

## What is Canary Deployment?

Canary deployment is a technique where a new version of an application is deployed to a small subset of servers or users before rolling it out to the entire infrastructure. This approach allows us to:

1. Test new features in production with real traffic
2. Detect issues early with minimal impact
3. Gradually increase confidence in the new version
4. Quickly rollback if problems are detected

## Quantum-Superbot Canary Architecture

Our canary deployment strategy uses two separate Heroku applications:

1. **quantum-superbot-canary**: Receives the new version first and handles a small percentage of traffic
2. **quantum-superbot**: The main production application that receives updates after successful canary validation

## Branch Strategy and Workflow Integration

Our canary deployments are integrated with our branch strategy:

1. **Feature Development**: Features are developed in `feature/*` branches
2. **Staging Integration**: Features are merged to `build-pipelines` for staging deployment
3. **Canary Deployment**: Canary deployments can be triggered from the staging workflow
4. **Production Deployment**: After canary validation, changes are merged to `heroku-deployment`

## Traffic Distribution

Traffic distribution between canary and production is managed through:

1. **Discord Gateway Sharding**: We configure the canary instance to handle specific shards, limiting its exposure to a subset of guilds
2. **Feature Flags**: New features can be enabled only for specific guilds or users on the canary instance
3. **Traffic Percentage**: Configured via environment variables to control what percentage of requests the canary handles

## Deployment Process

### 1. Staging Deployment

Before any code reaches canary or production, it goes through:
- Automated testing (unit, integration, and end-to-end tests)
- Deployment to the staging environment via the `staging-deploy.yml` workflow
- Manual verification and testing

### 2. Canary Deployment

Once code passes staging:
- The new version is deployed to `quantum-superbot-canary` using the canary option in the staging workflow
- Initially handles 20% of traffic (configurable)
- Enhanced monitoring and logging are enabled
- Automated smoke tests verify basic functionality
- Performance and error metrics are collected for 5 minutes

### 3. Metrics Evaluation

The canary deployment is evaluated based on:
- Error rates compared to baseline
- Performance metrics (response times, resource usage)
- User-impacting issues reported
- System stability indicators

### 4. Production Rollout or Rollback

Based on canary metrics:
- If successful: Deploy to main production application by merging to `heroku-deployment`
- If issues detected: Rollback canary and investigate

## Implementation Details

The canary deployment is implemented through:

1. **GitHub Actions Workflows**:
   - `staging-deploy.yml`: Handles deployment to staging with canary option
   - `production-deploy.yml`: Manages canary and production deployments
   - `heroku-deploy.yml`: Handles the actual deployment to Heroku

2. **CI/CD Components**:
   - `canary_monitor.py`: Monitors canary deployments and compares metrics
   - `deployment_tests.py`: Verifies deployment readiness
   - `traffic_router.py`: Manages traffic distribution between environments

3. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Canary-specific environment variables control behavior
   - Feature flags can be toggled independently on canary

## Canary Deployment Commands

To manually trigger canary deployments:

```bash
# Trigger the staging workflow with canary option
gh workflow run staging-deploy.yml -f deploy_type=canary

# Deploy to canary with 20% traffic
gh workflow run production-deploy.yml -f deploy_percentage=20

# Increase canary traffic to 50%
gh workflow run production-deploy.yml -f deploy_percentage=50

# Rollback canary deployment
gh workflow run production-deploy.yml -f rollback=true
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

During canary deployments, we have enhanced monitoring:

1. **Real-time Metrics Dashboard**: Shows side-by-side comparison of canary vs. production
2. **Automated Alerts**: Triggered if canary metrics deviate significantly from production
3. **Error Reporting**: Increased verbosity on canary for faster debugging

## Best Practices

When using our canary deployment system:

1. **Small, Incremental Changes**: Prefer smaller, more frequent deployments
2. **Feature Flags**: Use feature flags for larger changes to control exposure
3. **Monitoring**: Always check canary metrics before proceeding to full production
4. **Documentation**: Document any special considerations for canary in PR descriptions

By following these practices, you can safely deploy new features to Quantum-Superbot with minimal risk and maximum confidence.
